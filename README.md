Image Classification with Machine Learning Alogirthms deployed in Azure ML Studio

Keyowrds: Azure Machine Learning Studio, Logistic regression, LeNet, AlexNet, Convolutional Neural Network, Pytorch, Python, hyperparameter tuning, Model Training and Deployment

The project is divided into five parts:

    1. CIFAR-10 Dataset Overview
    2. Model Implementation
    3. Training Preparation
    4. Model Training and Fine-tuning
    5. Model Deploying

This Machine Learning end-to-end project consists of the following tasks:

    1. Transform and normalize tensor data
    2. Implement Logistic regression, LeNet, and AlexNet using PyTorch.
    3. Perform hyperparameter tuning to meet a given performance requirement.
    4. Identify the tradeoff between training time and training cost when using CPU vs GPU.
    5. Deploy the trained model to a public API endpoint.
